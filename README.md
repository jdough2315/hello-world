# hello-world
Well, since this is a Hello, World file, I suppose I might as well tell you who I am. I am brankd-spanking new to programming, and you should assume that I know absolutely nothing, because I do. 
I currently work a job that is beyond soul sucking, and now that I finally have a computer, I've decided to teach myself how to program, and see if I can work that self-education into a job where I can actually solve problems. 
I am also documenting every single step I am taking and will be sharing this with people who are in the same position that I am now, so they can see if A: it works, and B: how to do it, provided that A=true. 
My process is basically to read/listen to other programmers and any time I hear a word or term that I have never heard of, I write it down so I can look it up later. 
This has lead me here to github, which I havent heard of before.

That's all I have to say about that, for now.

Till next time. 

Cheers.
